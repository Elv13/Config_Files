DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is set of (improved) artwiz fonts.
The ultimate solution to your all problems with artwiz fonts.

I like those fonts but couldn't use them with gtk2/kde3 apps anymore.
The fonts were really messed up, running fc-cache didn't generate proper
font.cache-1 file (freetype font indexes).
I only changed font properities (except cursor.pcf) so they are now
properly recognized as freetype fonts and they still look so damn cool
as artwiz designed them.
Note: running mkfontdir will now also generate proper entiries.


INSTALLATION

	cd your_font_dir
